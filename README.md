# Maria Final Project 

  This website was built by Maria Thomasson as my final project at the Technigo coding bootcamp. The project is a combination between school and my new job and aims to create value to our customers showing an integration between Qlik charts and webpages and how you can style them.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
